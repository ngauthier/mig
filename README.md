# `mig`: the littlest migrator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngauthier/mig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ngauthier/mig)

`mig` is a minimal application migration tool. It comes with very strong conventions around how
migrations should be managed and how your application is configured. If you have a
[12 factor app](https://12factor.net/) on a cloud PAAS then `mig` should work for you.
